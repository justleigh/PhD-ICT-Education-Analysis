# Variable Selection and Mapping

## 1. Selection Criteria
Based on the PISA ICT Framework and Multi-Level Framework of Technology Acceptance and Use (MLFTAU), the following criteria were used to guide variable selection:

- **Relevance to Research Questions**: Only variables that directly support the research objectives were considered.
- **Alignment with Theoretical Constructs**: Variables were chosen to represent specific constructs within the frameworks.
- **Data Availability and Quality**: Variables with complete and reliable data were prioritized.
- **Policy Relevance**: Variables with implications for policy or educational practices were emphasized.
- **Equity Considerations**: Where applicable, variables that highlight potential disparities were included.

## 2. Overview of Available Variables
Below is an overview of the variables available in the PISA 2022 dataset, with notes on their potential relevance:

| Variable Name           | Description                                   | Relevance                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| ICT_availability        | Availability of ICT resources in schools      | Important for assessing resource equity |
| Teacher_training        | Teacher training level in ICT                 | Reflects teacher readiness for ICT integration |
| School_location         | Urban or rural classification                 | Relevant for examining geographic disparities |
| ...                     | ...                                           | ...                               |

## 3. Final List of Selected Variables and Mapping
This table maps each selected variable to its respective framework construct, with a rationale for inclusion.

| Variable Name           | Framework Construct      | Description                                | Rationale for Inclusion                |
